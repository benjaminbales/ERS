#  Employee Reimbursement System Revature

## Project Description
ERS is a full stack web application that enables two types of user, an employee and a manager, to login and perform various actions.  Employees can submit new reimbursement requests, view their pending and resolved requests, and update their personal information.

They can also filter by the employee ID to see the requests for individuals and empoyees, and they can register new employees.
